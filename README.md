# Integrated-Disaster-Response-System-IDRS-

The Integrated Disaster Response System (IDRS) is a proof-of-concept for a humanitarian aid platform leveraging artificial intelligence. It integrates three distinct AI models to provide real-time situational awareness, resource allocation, and communication during natural disasters. The system aims to enhance the speed and effectiveness of disaster relief efforts by analyzing data from various sources (e.g., social media, satellite imagery) and providing actionable insights to first responders and aid organizations.
